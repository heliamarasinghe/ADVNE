Aggregation-based Discovery for Virtual Network Environments ICC_2012

Resource discovery aims to assist the Virtual Network Provider (VNP) in selecting the best Infrastructure Provider (InP) 
which has the best matching resources, for a Virtual Network (VN) request. 
It provides information about substrate resources that are advertised by InPs. In the current literature, 
resource discovery focuses mainly on static (functional) attributes 
of physical infrastructures with an emphasis on efficient organization of discovered data. 
In this paper we are proposing an aggregation based approach, called Aggregation-based Discovery for Virtual Network Environments (ADVNE). 
ADVNE allows VNP to make use of information on dynamic (non-functional) attributes to enhance the efficiency of resource discovery process 
while minimizing the continuous monitoring overhead. 
We analyze the performance of ADVNE and show its importance in VN embedding.
